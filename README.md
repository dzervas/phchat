# PHChat

# Dont' use this

This project is fairly bad written and (as you can see) unmaintained.

I keep this as it's my first "real" project when I was 14-15 years old (~2010) adn it was uploaded some years later, when I learned about git. I've made some fixes just to get it running, keeping the bad (and sometimes wrong) styling I used back then.

Don't be harsh to my young self :D

To run this you need PHP <= 5.4 with `mysql` and `socket` extensions. Not `mysqli`, `mysql`. The `sqlite` interface seem to be completely broken...
